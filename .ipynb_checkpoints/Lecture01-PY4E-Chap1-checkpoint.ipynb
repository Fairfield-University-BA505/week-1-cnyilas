    "# Building Blocks of Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the low-level conceptual patterns used to construct programs:\n",
    "- __Input__: get data from the \"outside world\". In above example, the input is the text (`my_text`);\n",
    "- __Output__: Display the results of the program. In above example, the output is the most common word (`the`) and its count (`7`);\n",
    "- __Sequential Execution__: Perform statements one after another in the _top-down_ order. For instance, when we declare `common_word` and `common_count`;\n",
    "- __Conditional Execution__: Check for certain condition then execute or skip a sequence of statements. In above example, the `if` statements;\n",
    "- __Repeated Execution__: Perform a sequence of statements repeatedly, usually with some variation. In above example, the `for` loops we used twice;\n",
    "- __Reuse__: Write a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse those instructions as needed throughout your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doesn't matter how complicated the program is - they are all built through these building blocks.\n",
    "- Knowing them will not guarantee you as a programmer; but knowing them is a good start.\n",
    "- Remember we said that the key takeaway of this course is 'programming logic' - programming logic refers to these blocks."
